        "  - Python is a programing language that used for the web developing, App developing and Data analyst etc.\n",
        "  - python is case sensitive language.\n",
        "  - python is very popular language to others programing language bcz it has lots of library and very close to the english language.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "  - A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. It translates Python code into machine code, which the computer can understand and run.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "  - Keywords in Python are predefined reserved words with special meanings so the interpreter can understand them. They perform specific tasks in Python programming and are a part of its syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "  - No, we can't used keywords as variable names because they are reserved words with predefined meanings in programming languages, and using them as variable names would lead to syntax errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",

        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "  - Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified). We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n",

        "  - In Python, type casting (also known as type conversion) is the process of converting a variable's data type to another, enabling flexible operations and data manipulation.\n",
        "Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "What it is:\n",
        "Type casting allows you to change the data type of a variable, such as converting an integer to a float, a string to an integer, or vice versa.\n",
        "  - Types of Type Casting:\n",
        "    1. Implicit Type\n",
        "    2. Explicit Type\n",
        "\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "- Implicit type casting is automatic, while explicit type casting is done by the programmer.\n",
        "  - Implicit Type Conversion: Python automatically converts data types in certain situations, like when performing operations on mixed data types (e.g., adding an integer and a float).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Explicit Type Conversion: You use Python's built-in functions (like int(), float(), str(), etc.) to manually convert data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. int(3.14) converts the float 3.14 to the integer 3.\n",
        "  2. float(5) converts the integer 5 to the float 5.0.\n",
        "  3. str(123) converts the integer 123 to the string \"123\".\n",
        "  4. int(\"123\") converts the string \"123\" to the integer 123.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "- Conditional statements in Python, like if, elif, and else, allow your program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false, enabling dynamic and flexible program behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "- The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example,\n",
        "  -  if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "- The key difference between \"for\" and \"while\" loops lies in their iteration\n",
        "control: \"for\" loops are used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, while \"while\" loops repeat until a condition is met, making them suitable for situations where the number of iterations is unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n",
        "- You don't know how many lines the file contains, so you need a loop that keeps reading line by line until there are no more lines to read. In such a case, a \"While Loop\" is more appropriate because the number of iterations needed isn't known in advance—it depends on the file's content."
